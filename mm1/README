INFO:

JobMan is a simple Upstart job manager.

First of all, it needs to be run with root privileges in order to be able to start or stop jobs, as well as disable/enable them.

However, if you just want to list the jobs and see which ones are running you can run it without root privileges (this is more safe :) ).

BUILD:

Libraries: In order to build it you will need to have installed following "dev" packages:
glib-2.0 
glibmm-2.4 
giomm-2.4
gtkmm-3.0 
gconfmm-2.6


How to build it:

- Open terminal
- Enter "package" folder and 
- run "./makeDebPackage.sh"

If everything goes well you'll end up with "jobMan_1.1-1_amd64.deb" file in the "package" folder. 

or ... send me an email and I can send you .deb package, but only for amd64 (my system is 64bit, it's a bit difficult to
compile for 32bit on it).

INSTALL:

Double click .deb file or execute in terminal:

$ sudo dpkg -i jobMan_1.1-1_amd64.deb

Then, find it in the Dash home by name "jobMan" or by description "upstart job manager"

REQUIREMENTS:

jobMan works on Ubuntu 11.10, have no idea if it works on other systems that use Upstart.

DISCLAIMER:

I really hope that you know what you are doing if you stop/restart/disable some really important system jobs. 
I take no responsibility for this piece of software or damage it can do to your system. Simply be carefull.

Code quality: really, really low.
Error handling: none, what so ever.

Why? Practice in C++, GDK+, gtkmm, etc ...
